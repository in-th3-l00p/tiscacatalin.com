built in 2024 as an experiment for people building brands, but also for the sake of developing on a microservice architecture

I started BeyondBrand because I kept seeing the same struggle around me: people have great product ideas, but their brand looks like a bad Canva template, their pitch is vague, their colors are random, and their communication is all over the place. Branding takes time, taste, and consistency & most early-stage founders don’t have any of those to spare.

So I built a platform that automates the painful parts of branding and helps you shape a clear identity from day one.

## what it does

BeyondBrand bundles a couple of tools into one place:
* automatic branding generation — names, descriptions, color palettes, logos, the whole starter identity
* business plan generator — a structured plan based on your idea
* photo editor for posts — perfect for Instagram carousels and brand content
* brand identity vault — keep your fonts, colors, assets, and tagline in one place
* networking forum — meet other builders, share progress, ask for feedback
* blog & resources — entrepreneurship tips, branding guides, experiments

The idea is simple: remove friction for early founders so they actually build something instead of drowning in branding decisions.

## ️how it’s built

Tech stack in plain language:
* Next.js for the frontend (SSR for speed + SEO)
* Node.js microservices with RabbitMQ for streaming
* MongoDB + Mongoose as the database
* Tailwind CSS (with clsx & tailwind-variants) for clean UI styling
* Strapi as the CMS (blog, landing pages, forum content)
* OpenAI models for all the generation magic
* AWS S3 for file storage
* Postman for integration testing

The system is monolithic from the user’s perspective, but internally it’s split into microservices. The photo editor is built using React components with global state handled through the Context API.

## goal

BeyondBrand exists to make brand creation feel fun instead of painful & help early-stage entrepreneurs get from idea 2 identity & presence in hours, not months.
