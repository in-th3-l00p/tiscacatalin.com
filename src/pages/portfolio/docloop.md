*it had happened so many times for me to search online for tools such as an image to pdf convertor, and all I got
were tools that were asking for dollars instead of doing what're they supposed to do*

## introducing *docloop*
a simple tool that creates PDFs. just that, no ads, no payment required. _helo_
