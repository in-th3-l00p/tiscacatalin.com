*"ngl I was never good at making money moves, therefore I've realized that tracking the 
way I'm spending might be the best decision"*

**cashloop** is a web app that provides tools for tracking monthly expenses and incomes.
Currently still in development, but I'm planning to build an AI agent that has the required
knowledge to help the users optimize their finances.

## tech stack
* Next.js - frontend & api routes for AI usage
* TailwindCSS + shadcn - 4 the UI
* Supabase - handling auth & database
