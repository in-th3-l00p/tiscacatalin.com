did my research on how tired the world is before publishing this: 48% of workers worldwide are burned out, and 85% have 
felt the crash. <small>[source](https://www.bcg.com/press/11june2024-half-of-workers-around-the-world-struggling-with-burnout)</small>

    6 hrs of sleep every single night, going on a streak for months. The self-deception that lies behind the sentence:
    "I got stuff to do" strikes on a daily basis while feeling like you're climbing a mountain every single morning
    when it's time to wake up.

## methamorphosis
Published during [Franz Kafka's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) lifetime, in 1915, 
**["The Metamorphosis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis)** is a novel that tells the story of a salesman,
that wakes up one morning transformed into a large insect one morning.

<div class="italic max-w-xl w-full text-center mx-auto">
    "As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams<br> he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect"<br>
    <small>~ the opening of "The Metamorphosis"</small>
</div>

However stupid it sounds, the way the story progresses makes it one of the most influential works.
