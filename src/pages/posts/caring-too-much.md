6 hrs of sleep every single night, going on a streak for months. The self-deception that lies behind the sentence:
*"I got stuff to do"* strikes on a daily basis while feeling like you're climbing a mountain every single morning
when it's time to wake up.

I relate this with a deeply personal note, therefore, had to do my research before publishing this: 48% of workers 
worldwide are burned out, and 85% have felt the crash.
