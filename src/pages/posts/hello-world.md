*Expressing yourself* might be one of the coolest hobbies to have. The realization that the things created
by you, either them being written, drawn, engineered whatever, are some raw images of yourself is though, maybe
cold. Creating is a good exercise of being confident, or at least not caring that much.

## topics & my style of writing
Quick disclaimer: *I resonate with being allegorical, in general.* , but as a technical somebody, I see
the importance of having an artistic manner of living significant. Anyway, I will publish stuff about stuff I'm building,
events I am attending, anything that I consider valuable enough to be shared - think this fits the picture

## background
Focused on development, participating at competitions, ranging from hackathons to olympiads. Learned how to properly
build software freelancing, mostly web development projects. Also I know a bit about robotics, web3, ML etc. from
personal projects.
