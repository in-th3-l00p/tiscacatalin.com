***Amerika*** is an *incomplete* first novel by Franz Kafka, being published after his death in 1927. The story
is centered around sixteen-year-old Karl Rossmann, who was forced to go, alone, to New York City.

## N.Y. state of mind 

The possibilities surrounding a teenager left alone in *the city that never sleeps* are endless. Therefore, the
plot becomes a realistic view of freedom. Throughout the action, *Karl Rossmann* travels through the extremities
of social statuses, staying some time under the supervision of his rich uncle, experiencing the American dream.

Regarding the universe emphasised in the novel, the Kafkaesque of it can be easily felt. New York is described
as oppressive, as the protagonist is dealing with the unfairness of the environment, leaving room for uncertainity
to settle, and express the fear of the future at its fullest. Karl is portrayed as a forgiving person in a 
treacherous world.

<span class="block text-center italic text-sm font-light">the way the Statue of Liberty is described in the story</span>

The Statue of Liberty symbolizes freedom, democracy, and the welcoming of immigrants seeking a new life in the United States. The story pictures it as holding a sword instead of the torch, expressing the inhospitality of the city
satirized within the action. The warning seems to be right regarding the fate of the boy in his teenage years.

## the quiet surrender of liberty

A central thematic thread in *Kafka*'s novel is the reccuring willingness of *Karl* to accept of even assist in
his own subjugation. Throughout the story, the teenager ends up in situations that are showing the worst of the
freedom offered by New York, such as being a prisoner in the aparatment of the ones pretending to be his friends.

At the same time, Kafka's novel manages to picture the opportunities to grow when placed in such environment.
He manages to get a job & establish connections using his personality, neglecting his social status. In a city
that tests him at every turn, each step forward becomes and act of quiet defiance. Keeping in consideration that
the same streets confine endless directions to take, *"Amerika"* suggests that the power to shape one's path still
exists. The world may not be freely given, but for those willing to claim it, **the world is yours**.

## beyond novels & stories

American rapper **Nas** caputed the similar tension in his 1994 debut album ***"Illmatic"***. In it, the streets are both a 
trap and a canvas, a place where survival demands vigilance, but where ambition can carve out a legacy. 

Much like Karl in Amerika, Nas’s lyrical protagonist navigates a world that offers no guarantees, only chances to seize. 
The album’s closing mantra, “The World Is Yours”, becomes not just a declaration but a challenge: the city won’t hand you 
freedom, but it will leave the door cracked open for those bold enough to step through.

## ending

Kafka never finished Amerika, and that’s the point. Karl’s story, like life itself, stays open. We don’t know if he wins or 
loses, and that uncertainty is what makes the possibilities feel endless. The unwritten ending reminds us that the path ahead 
is ours to imagine, and maybe, to claim.
